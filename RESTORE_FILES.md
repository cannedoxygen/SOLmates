# Restore Deleted Files

## Quick Git Restore (Recommended)

If you're using git, run these commands to restore all deleted files:

```bash
cd /Users/cannedoxygen/Downloads/solmates

# Check what files were deleted
git status

# Restore all deleted files
git checkout HEAD -- .

# Or restore specific files if needed
git checkout HEAD -- admin-fix.js
git checkout HEAD -- debug-supabase.js
# (repeat for other files)

# Verify restoration
git status
```

## Alternative: Undo Last Git Commit

If you committed the deletions:

```bash
# Undo the last commit but keep changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Or completely undo the last commit and changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Manual Restore (If no git)

If you don't have git or need to restore specific files, let me know which files are missing and causing issues. I can recreate the essential ones.

## Check What's Causing the App Issues

Run this to see what's broken:

```bash
cd /Users/cannedoxygen/Downloads/solmates
npm start
```

The error messages will tell us exactly which files are missing and needed.

## Most Likely Culprits

The files most likely to break the app if removed:
- `polyfills.js` - Required for React Native
- `metro.config.js` - Build configuration
- `index.js` - App entry point

If any of these were accidentally removed, I can recreate them immediately.

Let me know what error you're seeing and I'll help fix it!
